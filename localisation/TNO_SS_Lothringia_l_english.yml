 POLITICS_Theodor_Eicke_DESC:0 "Betrayed, forgotten, abandoned. The Hangman has lost his way, but in the name of Germany, a new dawn, no, a new era, will begin.\n\nTheodor Eicke was born in the boiling stew of violence and rage which would spill over into the Great War, where he managed to find himself decorated for his courage along the front lines, even if he managed paychecks behind the lines most of the time. Nevertheless, the failures of democracy crashed hard upon Eicke as he fell into poverty and joblessness with the onset of Weimar's corruption and degeneracy; however, that was all until the National Socialist German Workers' Party came along. From then on, it was blood that earned Eicke his medals, be it the blood of his former commander, Ernst Röhm, or be it the blood of every single degenerate, handicapped, or corrupted subhuman that Eicke witnessed die within the concentration camp.\n\nTo Eicke, the German Reich had finally realized that it was strength that it needed for its people, and allowing any of these affronts to the Aryan image live would be an unacceptable slight against Germany's power. After the war, a lifetime of devotion and desire to please Himmler found him as a strong-and-true official within the Deutsche-SS, as SS-Obergruppenführer Eicke, despite his occasionally rocky relationship with Reinhard Heydrich, realized his true potential in destroying any traces of corruption within the Vaterland.\n\nBut, no. That bastard, Heydrich, that wretched beast ruined it all! He tore Germany apart, and left us all with nothing, leaving the process to transform the Reich into something more pure than ever in tatters! We must do what we can to honor the Reichsführer-SS, and purge Heydrich for his betrayal against the Burgundian System."

 SSL_burgundy_wannabe:0 "Burgundian Wannabe"
 SSL_burgundy_wannabe_desc:0 "SS-Obergruppenführer Eicke strove throughout his entire career within the Deutsche-SS to remain a loyal butcher for the Aryan cause. Now that Heydrich has betrayed Himmler and the Aryan race in favor of what Eicke sees as decadence and politics, he has taken it upon himself to build within his fiefdom a Burgundian Ordensstaat west of the Rhine."
 
 SSL_burgundian_pawn:0 "Himmler's Pawn"
 SSL_burgundian_pawn_desc:0 "Loyal to Himmler until the end, the SS-Ordensstaat Lothringen remains a piece upon the chessboard that Burgundy can move about freely... for now."
